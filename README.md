**Bone Apple Teeth**

Bone Apple Teeth is a website for all of the cooks in the world. Simply log in to view, edit, delete, or add a new recipe. Once a recipe is complete it is added to the home page for all to see, so make sure everything is updated.

**Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery/JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose
- CRUD (7 RESTful routes)

**Approach Taken**

My initial approach was to create a site where you could view and create your own recipes. Being a family full of cooks, I wanted to create something that we could all use to revert back to if we had any questions about a specific recipe we're working on

**Issues/Problems/Errors**

Receiving an error message in terminal stating that it cannot read the property 'id' of undefined, referring to my array. However all of my data is displaying on the page with no errors.

Trying to figure out how to display the information the user enters into the ingredients/directions field into a list instead of a continuous string.
